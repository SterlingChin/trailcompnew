          The goal with Trail Companion is to make sure you are never alone while in the back country. We use your GPS on your
          phone to store your location every 5 minutes even if you don't have cell service. <br><br> 
          But, we never store your information. Security is our number one priority. All the GPS data is saved locally on the phone and you have complete control over your data. We don't store any GPS data in our servers. <br>
